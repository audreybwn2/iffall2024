        <p class="topic">Cooking Tips:</p>
        <p class="tips"><strong>1.</strong> Purple sweet potatoes are denser and starchier than normal ones. <strong>Be careful not to overcook them</strong> or they may dry out!</p>
        <p class="tips"><strong>2.</strong> Don't forget to <strong>line your baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat</strong> to prevent your potatoes from sticking.</p>
        <p class="tips"><strong>3.</strong> If using a rimless baking sheet, decrease your baking time by a few minutes. But regardless, <strong>always check on your fries every 5 minutes after flipping!</strong></p>
        <p class="tips"><strong>4.</strong> To store, <strong>keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days</strong>. Reheat in a skillet with some olive oil over medium-low heat for best results.</p>
