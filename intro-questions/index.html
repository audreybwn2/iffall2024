        <h1>Audrey's Intro Questions</h1>

        <p> 
        <ol>
    1. Hello! I'm <b>Audrey</b>, a senior pursuing a BA in CommDes with minors in Marketing + HCI.
        </p>
        <p>
    2. I was intrigued by this class as I am passionate about learning HTML/CSS to grasp front-end development skills. I am also passionate about the intersections between Business and Design.
        </p>
        <p>
    3. No, I do not have much experience coding with HTML/CSS/JS.
        </p>
        <p>
    4. I hope to gain comfort leveraging HTML/CSS to create websites that are also accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
    5. I believe that designing for the screen will differ from designing for paper as it places a large emphasis on troubleshooting and browser refreshing.
        </p>
        <p>
    6. I believe that the promotional website for <a href="https://config.figma.com">ConFig 2024 </a> exemplifies effective design. This is because it utilizes a consistent typeface pairing, color palette, and adds a pop of excitement via its interactive, hoverable "CONFIG" letters.
        </p>
        <p>
    7. I believe that a website that exemplifies effective communication is the <a href="https://mejuri.com">Mejuri website</a>. This is because it effectively combines high-quality product images with text (when needed), showcasing a strategic relationship between images and text. Here, the emphasis is on the product itself via imagery but text backs up the product's information when the product does not speak for itself.
        </p>
        <p>
    8. I believe that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals/?_encoding=UTF8&ref_=nav_cs_gb&discounts-widget=%2522%257B%255C%2522state%255C%2522%253A%257B%255C%2522refinementFilters%255C%2522%253A%257B%255C%2522departments%255C%2522%253A%255B%255C%25227141124011%255C%2522%255D%257D%257D%252C%255C%2522version%255C%2522%253A1%257D%2522&bubble-id=fashion&pd_rd_w=FLm6k&content-id=amzn1.sym.249347a0-4e5d-4164-be70-cfb70b362be5&pf_rd_p=249347a0-4e5d-4164-be70-cfb70b362be5&pf_rd_r=AD55B90FHV3415JP78H3&pd_rd_wg=btrUO&pd_rd_r=bc824977-2930-4baa-bf90-3fcf0795265e">Amazon website </a> works well. This is because at its core, the website is able to house 12M+ different products to market to consumers. Thus, the website is able to accomodate a large amount of website data.
