        <h2>Recipe Page</h2>
        <p>
            This Recipe Page is centered around providing simple, step-by-step instructions for cooking delicious Purple Sweet Potato Fries.
            It also lists crucial information like total cooking time, nutritional information, and even cooking tips. Inspiration for this page mixed
            my recent fascination with exploring different fry styles with desire to create a smooth, responsive site.

        <h2>Microsite &#40;Designer/Developer&#41;</h2>
        <p>
            This Microsite was created in exercising the role of Designer/Developer, crafting an informational website that was inspired by my Creative Director's
            vision about the iconic film "In the Mood for Love" by Wong Kar-wai. Site content is sourced from Wiki and is presented using strategic color, font, and image usage.
            The project allowed me to explore topics such as responsive grid layouts, attributing content to original sources, and diving into a unique topic with a partner.

        <h2>Microsite &#40;Creative Director&#41;</h2>
        <p>
            This Microsite was created in exercising the role of Creative Director, providing the overarching vision and strategy for a website centered around the Texas Hold'Em poker variant.
            Site content is sourced from Wiki and I communicated with my Designer/Developer to help bring the site's content structure as well as font, image, and color usage to life.
            The project was exciting to collaborate on and skills like active communication and flexibility were exercised.

        <h2>Button Styling Exercise</h2>
        <p>
            Additionally, I wanted to feature my Button Styling Exercise, where I designed 10 buttons for recognizable brands.
            This exercise helped me practice crafting dynamic buttons via pulling from brand identities.
